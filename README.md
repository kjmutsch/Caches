# Caches
Learning Goals:

The purpose of the first part is to understand more about how caches work and learn a bit about simulation along the way. 
To really understand the basics of how a cache works, I created a small cache simulator.
My cache simulator is in "csim.c". It takes a valgrind memory trace as input, simulates the hit/miss/eviction behavior of a cache memory on this trace, and outputs the total number of hits, misses and evictions.
